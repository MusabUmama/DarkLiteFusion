DarkLiteFusion: Lightweight Action Recognition in Low-Light Conditions

## Overview

DarkLiteFusion is a lightweight hybrid model for video action recognition in low-light environments, developed as part of a BSc Honours Project at Robert Gordon University. It combines EfficientNet-Lite0 for spatial feature extraction and a 3-frame Temporal Shift Module (TSM) for efficient temporal modeling. Trained on the ARID dataset, it achieves 85.83% (Split 0) and 84.08% (Split 1) Top-1 accuracy with 3.39M parameters and 2.24 GMac.
